# lectio

Teammates [LunarCoffee](https://github.com/LunarCoffee), [viktorKorolyuk](https://github.com/viktorKorolyuk) and [YT-Main](https://github.com/YT-Main).
They were all awesome teammates, we got a lot of stuff done.

This was submitted for [PC Hacks 2019](https://pchacks19.devpost.com/), [here's our submission](https://devpost.com/software/lectio).
The idea was to provide a platform for dyslexic individuals to practice and increase reading accuracy.
We used tts/stt along with the [Dyslexie Font](https://www.dyslexiefont.com/en/typeface/) to make the experience as fluid as possible.
This project ended up getting first place in the hackathon!
